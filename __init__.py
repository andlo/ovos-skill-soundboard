SKELETON ONLY - not implemented yet.

A sound-effects board for OVOS - 'play a drum roll', 'play applause', 'play an air horn'. Same bundled-CC0-sample pattern as ovos-skill-sound-like, but for stock sound effects rather than animal/object sounds. Could plausibly share infrastructure with ovos-skill-sound-like rather than being fully separate - worth revisiting once both exist.

See README.md ("Why this exists") and DEVELOPMENT.md ("Design notes")
before starting real implementation - several open design questions
are noted there and should be resolved (ideally reviewed) before
writing the real intent logic, same process ovos-skill-convert and
ovos-skill-sound-like followed.
